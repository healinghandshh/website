compassion DONE EXCEPT FOR TRANSITION (have this in big words somewhere with nice fade-slide transition in)

create MEMORABLE healing hands logo, not basic one; have two stick people with hand on a heart between them, encapsulated within a heavenly glow, and words surrounding them in a circle saying "healing hands, healing hearts" (maybe green stick people w black words or vv) DONE!!!!!

Create HSL color scheme after writing the HTML

different css files to allow for readability/color blindness & different colors e.g. dark mode, light mode, red, blue (save for last)

--- You build a website in layers, as if you are making a multi-layered cake.

1st Layer - First you build the base, the container div, with it's min-height and width css.

2nd Layer - Then you build the next layer, the large sections of the page (divs and styling for structure), such as rows or sections looking like columns.

3rd Layer and beyond - Then you keep adding within the second layer of sections.
